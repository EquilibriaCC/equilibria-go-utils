Go package for use with the Monero crypto-currency.

Not much has been implemented so far, but you can view
the documentation at http://godoc.org/github.com/ehmry/monero

The most interesting that has been built with it
thus far is a vanity address generator.

Install it with this:
	$ go install github.com/ehmry/monero/monero-vanity

When it matches an input regex it prints out an address and a
secret key in hex form. Use the -convert option to get an 
Electrum word list and then use the recovery feature of 
simplewallet to build a new wallet file.

It comes with the option to encrypt output to a PGP key, useful
when running on 'borrowed cycles'. Just make sure to pipe the
output to a file or all you'll end up with is a trashed terminal.

Good luck!
